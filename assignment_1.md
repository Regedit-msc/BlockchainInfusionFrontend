## JS

-  Create a function that takes in 5 numbers and adds them together. If the total number if equal to 20, log "Numer is equal to twenty", else if the number is greater than 20 but lesser than 40, log "The number is greater than 20 but lesser than 40", else log "The number is biggg o";


- Create a `for` loop that loops through an `array` of items and lists them out one by one.

- Do the same as what's above with a `while` loop.
